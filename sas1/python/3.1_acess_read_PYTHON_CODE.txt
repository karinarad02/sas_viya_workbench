# Accessing and reading local files
Upload the files from the laptop to VS Code in the /workspace/myfolder/sas1/data/directory
import pandas as pd
## Acess the csv file
subscriptions_df = pd.read_csv('../data/input/subscriptions.csv')

subscriptions_df.info()
subscriptions_df
## Acess the Json file
json_df = pd.read_json('../data/input/reviews.json')
json_df.head()
The data is read in with a bad format, we need to tell pandas to read each row as data since each row is a dictionary.
reviews_df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(json_df['reviews'])
reviews_df.head()
## Acess the SAS data set
techsupportevals_df = pd.read_sas('../data/input/techsupportevals.sas7bdat')
techsupportevals_df.head()
