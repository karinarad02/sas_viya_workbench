# Reading data from SnowFlake tables
Ensure you have 'snowflake' and 'pyarrow' installed on your workbench for this process to work. Begin by importing the required packages.
import pandas as pd

import snowflake as sf
import snowflake.connector
import json
## Initialize Database connection variables
Credentials are stored in the snowflake_cred.json file and need to be accessed. Hard coding credentials should always be avoided.
sf_credential = '../keys/snowflake_cred.json'

# with open(sf_credential, "r") as f:
#     sf_credential_dict = json_load(f)
## Connection to Snowflake Database
We open the connection by calling sf.connector.connect() with the parameters set to our credentials.
conn = sf.connector.connect(**sf_credential_dict)
Create a cursor object from the connection to execute queries
cursor = conn.cursor()
## Read data from Snowflake database table.
Execute Snowflake queries with execute() method. NB: The table name will always be capitalized in a Snowflake query unless you encapsulate it in quotes!
cursor.execute('select * from "customers"').fetch_pandas_all()

customers_df
Always close the connection when finished!
conn.close()
# Data improv

customers_df = pd.read_sas('../data/input/snowflake/customers.sas7bdat')
customers_df.info()
