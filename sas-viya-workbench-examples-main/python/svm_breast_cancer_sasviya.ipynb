    "In addition to the parameters discovered by training a model, algorithms rely on hyperparameters to control the training process and the resulting parameters. The reasons for choosing particular values may involve a priori knowledge, intuition, or guessing, but can have a significant impact on the quality of the generated model for whatever reason they were selected.  A more methodical approach is to use a grid search algorithm that examines the space of parameter combinations to help identify the best performing hyperparameters.  This example uses `GridSearchCV` from scikit-learn to show one mechanism for doing this where the grid search is supplemented by cross-validation for model evaluation."
